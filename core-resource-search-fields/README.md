core-resource-search-fields
===========================

##### Deal with hidden indexes for CmsResources (I.E. siteCmsResourceId on PageCmsResource)

- Each CmsResource has indexes we can search by that are not in the data model
- Defining the indexes can allow is to document them Zrcms\CoreResourceSearchFields
- Defining the indexes can also allow for where validations
